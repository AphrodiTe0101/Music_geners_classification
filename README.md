# Music Genre Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying music genres using audio signal processing and feature extraction techniques. The work is implemented in Python within a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Project Overview

Music genre classification is a core task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). This project builds a classification system using audio features such as **MFCC**, **Chroma**, **Spectral Centroid**, **Spectral Bandwidth**, and **Mel Spectrograms**. Models are evaluated to understand how different features contribute to classification performance.

## Features

* End-to-end workflow for music genre classification
* Audio preprocessing and feature extraction using **Librosa**
* Machine learning model training with **Scikit-learn**
* Use of **SVM** and additional ML algorithms for comparison
* Visualizations of audio features and classification results
* Clear and structured notebook for reproducibility and learning

---

##  Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Librosa** (audio feature extraction)
* **NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Repository Contents

* **Music_geners_classification.ipynb** — main notebook containing feature extraction, model training, and evaluation
